# SAMR34_DFP
Device Family Pack for Microchip ATSAMR34 SIP with Semtech SX1276 LoRa radio

This Device Family Pack supports the Microchip ATSAMR34 family devices
(ATSAMR34J16B, ATSAMR34J17B, ATSAMR34J18B) in Microchip's MPLAB X IDE.
It currently does not support the ATSAMR35 family (similar to
ATSAMR34 but without USB support) although this support could easily be added.
This pack is installable through the "Install local pack" feature of the
MPLAB IDE Pack Manager.
